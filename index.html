<h2>LeBron is on the verge of becoming #1 On The NBA's All-Time Scoring List</h2>


<div>
	<p> Since April 5th, 1984, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has been atop of the NBA's all-time scoring list. At the time, LeBron James had yet to be born, let alone, one of the greatest players to grace the game. 38 years later, LeBron James has the once-in-a-generation opportunity to surpass Mr. Abdul-Jabbar as the NBA All-Time Scoring Leader. As of early November, LeBron only needs to score 1,117 points to reach this milestone. At his career scoring average of 27.1 PPG, James would need to play 44 games to reach his goal. "I feel like this will cement him as the greatest of all-time, people don't even perceive him as a scorer and he's literally about to be leading scorer of all-time," according to Amari J. Mitchell, a former content producer for ESPN's First Take. "I definitely see Bron breaking the record before the end of the season." At the moment, he's projected to become the "King of NBA points" by January 28th, 2023 during his game against the Boston Celtics if he remains healthy and doesn't miss any games.If he achieves this feat, he will alter history forever. Fans are in high hopes that King James will be able to solidify his crown by the end of this season. Let's see if he can do it. #GoLeBron #RIPKobe! </p>
